The restaurants, typical bars and places of interest are just a footstep away. Next to the house you will find the old city wall with “La Puerta Cerrada” (Closed Door), one of the 4 old entrances to the village."
    p2: "The centuries-old house has been restored maintaining Moorish features but with a 21th century twist. The house has 4 double rooms situated around a typical patio. It has a lot of cozy corners: read a book next to the patio’s library or enjoy the roof terrace with its long chairs and chill-out corners. We promise you an unforgettable stay!"

Discover picturesque corners, medieval gates, flowered patios and the important craft tradition. The white sanded beaches of El Palmar are only 10 minutes away. <br/><br/>Vejer de la Frontera has recently been proclaimed as the second most beautiful village of Spain by TripAdviser.
